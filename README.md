# keymaker

## Overview

Keymaker is a zero-dependency `Golang` package that makes it easy to generate API keys in your application.
<br>
<br>
This package was inspired by an excellent YouTube video done by Josh Twist (CEO & Co-founder at [zuplo](https://zuplo.com/)) titled [API Key Authentication Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooyOmiczY1g)

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/williepotgieter/keymaker
```

## API Key format

The package generates API keys in the following standardized format:

```text
<LABEL>_<SECRET>_<CHECKSUM>
```

### Label

Labelling API keys is a convenient way to make keys easily identifiable between differen environments or purpose. Labels can be any string.

#### Examples

- `skp` => **s**hareable **k**ey **p**roduction
- `pks` => **p**ublishable **k**ey **s**taging

### Secret

Secrets are random strings made up of characters `a-z`, `A-Z` and `0-9`. They are automatically generated by the package using Golang's built-in `rand/crypto` package and a [Fisher-Yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) shuffling algorithm. The length of the secret can be adjusted as required, but can be **maximum 256** charaters.

#### Examples

- `15nd14iju19qV3s63379a5iJz1jGunI` => 32 characters
- `Kl1kD9mj7ZU742K399Sr03Uo5Acb21Gu8I3Y2c13e23Eko4B7ew1zZy10207Pm02` => 64 characters

### Checksum

The checksum is the computed [CRC-32 checksum](https://wiki.osdev.org/CRC32) of the generated key, using Golang's built-in `hash/crc32` package.

#### Examples

- `995215320` => 32 character secret
- `1215000562` => 64 character secret

### What will the generated keys look like?

#### Example 1

`skp_15nd14iju19qV3s63379a5iJz1jGunI_995215320`

#### Example 2

`pks_Kl1kD9mj7ZU742K399Sr03Uo5Acb21Gu8I3Y2c13e23Eko4B7ew1zZy10207Pm02_1215000562`
